Pocodex lets you use Codex.app in a regular browser, including on your phone or any other remote device. It's like Claude Code's Remote Control, but for Codex!

It serves the real Codex desktop webview from `Codex.app`, reuses the bundled `codex app-server` as the agentic harness, and adds host-side shims for the desktop functionality the UI expects.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -g pocodex
```

## Run

```bash
pocodex
```

Pocodex prints a local URL and, when applicable, an "Open" URL. Open the printed URL in your browser.

## Requirements

- macOS with a local Codex install, usually `/Applications/Codex.app`
- Node.js 24 or newer

## Common Usage

Run with the defaults:

```bash
pocodex
```

Expose it on your LAN with a session token:

```bash
pocodex --listen 0.0.0.0:8787 --token "$(openssl rand -hex 16)"
```

When listening on `0.0.0.0`, Pocodex also prints a preferred LAN URL if it can find one.

## CLI

```text
pocodex [--token <secret>] [--app /Applications/Codex.app] [--listen 127.0.0.1:8787] [--dev]
```

### Flags

- `--token` optional session secret used to authorize the browser session
- `--app` path to the Codex app bundle
- `--listen` host and port to bind, for example `127.0.0.1:8787` or `0.0.0.0:8787`
- `--dev` watches `src/pocodex.css` and pushes live CSS reload events to the connected browser

If you expose Pocodex beyond loopback, use a long random token. When configured, the token gates `/session`, and the browser bootstrap stores it in `sessionStorage` so reconnects can work without re-entering it.

## How It Works

### 1. Reuse the real Codex UI

Pocodex reads and `Contents/Resources/app.asar` and serves those files. The browser is running the real Codex desktop UI, not a reimplementation.

### 2. Patch the webview entrypoint

Before serving `index.html`, Pocodex injects:

- `pocodex.css`
- an inline bootstrap script that installs the browser-side bridge
- a matching CSP hash so the injected script can run under Codex's content security policy

### 3. Reuse Codex's bundled app server

Pocodex starts the app server shipped inside the `Codex.app` bundle:

```text
codex app-server --listen stdio://
```

That process is used as the core agentic harness. Pocodex then bridges the browser session to it.

### 4. Shim the desktop host behavior

Codex's webview expects to live inside Electron with a pile of host APIs behind it. Pocodex provides custom shims for the browser-hosted setup instead:

- terminal sessions are backed by local PTYs via `node-pty`
- git integration is bridged through the desktop git worker extracted from the Codex bundle
- browser `vscode://codex/ipc-request` traffic is translated onto Pocodex's host IPC endpoint
- workspace roots, persisted atoms, and related desktop state are mirrored on the host side
- unsupported native features are blocked or stubbed where needed

The shim behavior was derived by treating the shipped and minified `Codex.app` code as the implementation oracle.

### 5. Connect the browser over a host HTTP server

Pocodex creates an HTTP server on the host machine and serves the patched webview from there. The browser loads the UI over HTTP, uses `/ipc-request` for host-style requests, and opens a live WebSocket session on `/session` for bridge traffic and worker messages.

An optional token can gate the browser session. Pocodex currently supports one active browser session at a time, so opening a new browser replaces the previous one.

## Current Limitations

- Only one active browser session is supported at a time
- Native desktop behaviors such as notifications, badge updates, context menus, power-save controls, and window mode controls are blocked or stubbed
- Generic IPC coverage is incomplete; unsupported IPC methods return an error response
- Streaming fetch is not implemented
- Some host fetch endpoints are stubbed with empty or placeholder data
- This relies on internal Codex bundle structure and host protocols, so Codex app updates may break assumptions
- Security is intentionally light; this is suitable for local use and trusted LANs, not public exposure
